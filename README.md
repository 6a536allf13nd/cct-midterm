Cultural Consensus Theory Report

I implemented a Bayesian Cultural Consensus Theory model using PyMC to analyze binary response data from 10 informants across 20 plant knowledge questions. The model estimated each informantâ€™s competence (i.e., their probability of answering correctly) and a consensus answer key representing culturally correct responses. I used a Beta(2, 2) prior for informant competence to reflect moderate prior uncertainty, and a Bernoulli(0.5) prior for each item in the consensus key. The model showed good convergence (R-hat values = 1.00), and posterior estimates were stable across chains.

The consensus answer key from the model was:
[0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1]
The majority vote answer key was:
[0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1]

These two differed on 5 questions. These differences occur because the CCT model accounts for varying competence levels among informants. These differences highlight the influence of competence-weighting in the CCT model: rather than treating each informant equally, the model estimates individual competence levels and gives more weight to answers from highly competent individuals. As a result, the consensus key is less biased by majority error and more reflective of informants who consistently demonstrate accurate knowledge.
